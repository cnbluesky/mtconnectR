## Submission
This is a new release. In this version I have:

* Added new functions to parse G Code and simulate device data from it 
* Also added functions to map simulated timestamps to actual timestamps and visualize the same

## Test environments
* local OS X install - 10.11.3 (15D21), R 3.2.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.3
* local Windows 7 install
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Windows (on Appveyor)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.

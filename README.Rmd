# Introduction

The MTConnectR package provides a way to read data from MTConnect to the statistical software R (www.r-project.org).  You can use the package to read data from historical MTConnect logs along with the devices.xml describing the device. The data is organised into a 'MTConnectDevice' S4 data structure and some convenience methods are also provided for basic read/view operations.

Description: The MTConnectR package provides a way to read data from MTConnect
    to the statistical software R (www.r-project.org). You can use the package to 1)
    read data from historical MTConnect logs along with the devices.xml describing
    the device or 2) Read the data directly from the MTConnect Agent for realtime
    streaming data. The data is organised into a 'MTConnectDevice' S4 data structure
    and some convenience methods are also provided for basic read/view operations.

# Using Scripts in MTConnectR Package

## get_data.R

This script can be used to contextualize data from a delimited log file and convert 
it into a csv format. You can have the data either in 1) long format - with multiple
timelines for each data item or 2) wide format - with a single timeline in which all
data items are together.
